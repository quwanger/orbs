Project Rollout
================

IMD Senior Project.

Notes:
Please check back for PR's and Issues regularily, (once every two days). Check out and import the project with Unity.


Decal System Tutorials
-------

We are using a free tool from that asset store named Decal System. Please watch www.youtube.com/watch?v=C87xkHj8jHMâ€Žto get a hang of it.
Also, we should credit Eidelweiss Interactive in our credits. They released a super powerful tool for free. 


Testing Scene Transitions and game flow
-------

We use a persistence manager that is created in the init scene. If you want to debug transitions, or play the game, open the init scene and play from there or build and run.


Pivotal Integreation
-------

We now integrate with pivotal. If you include a pivotal story id in a branch name if will be added to the story as a comment:

`Branch Name: 1923049-new-feature`

You can also tag stories in commits with the number in the commit message, formatted like this:

`[#1238492] Fixes some problem`

We should have a pivotal story for every branch. If you are doing something that does not have a pivotal story associated with it, create one!
