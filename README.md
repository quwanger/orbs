Decal System Tutorials
-------

We are using a free tool from that asset store named Decal System. Please watch www.youtube.com/watch?v=C87xkHj8jHMâ€Žto get a hang of it.
Also, we should credit Eidelweiss Interactive in our credits. They released a super powerful tool for free. 


Testing Scene Transitions and Game Flow
-------

We use a persistence manager that is created in the init scene. If you want to debug transitions, or play the game, open the init scene and play from there or build and run.
